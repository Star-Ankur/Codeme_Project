# Project Unexplored Himalayas

The pristine Himalayas offer a diverse and enchanting landscape that attracts travelers from across the globe. But most of the tourist attractions are centered around only a few popular locations.
Our team aims to build a website that promotes the lesser known wonders of this tranquil ecosystem. This way we can foster tourism in other locations in around the himalayan region which will promote sustainability to smaller less privelaged regions.
